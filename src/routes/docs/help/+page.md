# Help

On the bottom of the screen is the toolbar. It contains the 4 tools on the left, as well as the button to change your selected character, and any other operations you can do on the left. These operations change depending on what tool you are using. Hover over them to see what they do and what the keybind for them is.

There are currently 4 tools:

- Cursor: Allows you to select a single tile at once, and set it to some character, and write words. You can copy and paste single characters while in cursor mode.
- Brush: Paints the currently selected character.
- Eraser: Paints the space character (just an eraser).
- Selector: Allows you to select an area of tiles. When its selected, you can cut, paste, copy, and clear the tiles inside it. You can also draw a box around it.
