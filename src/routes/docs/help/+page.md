# Help

The little character at the bottom left of the screen is your currently selected
character. By default it is '-'. You can change it by clicking on it, or pressing
Ctrl+F. You can see the keybinds for each button by hovering over it.

The first tool is the cursor. Click on a tile to select it. When one is selected,
you can use the arrow keys to move the cursor around. You can press backspace to
delete the selected character, and move back one. If you press any other character,
it will change the selected tile to that character.

Brush paints the selected character. Eraser pains the space character.

The selection tool can be used to export your drawing. Select everything you want
to copy, and press Ctrl+C, or use the copy button at the bottom right.
